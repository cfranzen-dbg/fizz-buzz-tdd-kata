# FizzBuzz Hexa

Implement a function that takes an integer `n` as input and does the following things:
* if the external FizzService returns that `n` is a fizz, it should return 'Fizz'
* if the Buzz database contains `n`, it should return 'Buzz'
* if both conditions are true for `n`, it should return 'FizzBuzz'
* else it should return the number as a string
